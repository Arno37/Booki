## Description

Booki is a web application designed to help users find accommodations and activities in the city of their choice.

## Project Overview

As part of my professional training as a web developer at the startup Booki, I am responsible for integrating the site’s interface using HTML and CSS. I am working closely with Sarah, the CTO, and Loïc, the UI designer.

## My Role

I have been provided with the completed desktop, tablet, and mobile mockups for the site, which I need to integrate. Along with the mockups, there is a summary note detailing the specifications and technical constraints to follow.

To get started, an initial file structure and base code for the project have been prepared:

- An index.html file containing the initial HTML code that I need to complete.
- A css folder containing one or more style.css files with preliminary CSS code that I also need to complete.
- An images folder containing all the images used on the site

This initial code provides the foundational HTML and CSS elements, and I will use it as a reference to develop the rest of the code. I must maintain the same folder structure and continuously version my project on Git throughout the development process.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Understanding of Git for version control

## Development

To start working on the project, open the index.html file in your preferred code editor and begin completing the HTML and CSS code as per the mockups and specifications provided.
